# not a regular Ruby program file

# Remember the difference between integers and floats:
# 1/2 equals 0
# but 1.0/2.0 equals 0.5
# It is important to know this difference to get these tests to pass.

# Also, you can use the following information to figure out what the equation
# is to convert between the two units, fahrenheit and celsius:
#
# 1. One degree fahrenheit is 5/9 of one degree celsius
# 2. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees celsius but 32 degrees fahrenheit
